by Google AI language researchers in 2018. Although its primary goal was to enhance the comprehension of the meaning of Google Search queries, BERT has since emerged as one of the most significant and complete architectures for a variety of natural language tasks, producing cutting-edge results on tasks like classifying sentence pairs and question-answer sets, among others. One of BERT's key characteristics is its flexibility, which enables it to execute many NLP jobs with cutting-edge accuracy (similar to the transfer learning used in Computer vision)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In this notebook, we will be using the Pytorch BERT model of deep learning to perform Multi-class sentiment classification of tweets.\n","\n","The dataset being used is available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/smile-twitter-emotion-dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KkeOSBcOLQH8"},"source":["## Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-05T10:08:48.511578Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-05T10:08:48.511064Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-05T10:08:50.652503Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-05T10:08:50.651080Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-05T10:08:48.511455Z"},"id":"-KPmp_zlLQIA","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch\n","import pandas as pd\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-05T10:15:20.828765Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-05T10:15:20.828315Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.027074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.025530Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-05T10:15:20.828729Z"},"id":"KCmfBCOVLQIP","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["df = pd.read_csv('Corona_NLP_train.csv', encoding='latin-1')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.340176Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.339736Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.358384Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.356999Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-05T10:15:21.340131Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>UserName</th>\n","      <th>ScreenName</th>\n","      <th>Location</th>\n","      <th>TweetAt</th>\n","      <th>OriginalTweet</th>\n","      <th>Sentiment</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>3799</td>\n","      <td>48751</td>\n","      <td>London</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>@MeNyrbie @Phil_Gahan @Chrisitv https://t.co/i...</td>\n","      <td>Neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>3800</td>\n","      <td>48752</td>\n","      <td>UK</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>advice Talk to your neighbours family to excha...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3801</td>\n","      <td>48753</td>\n","      <td>Vagabonds</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>Coronavirus Australia: Woolworths to give elde...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3802</td>\n","      <td>48754</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>My food stock is not the only one which is emp...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   UserName  ScreenName   Location     TweetAt  \\\n","0      3799       48751     London  16-03-2020   \n","1      3800       48752         UK  16-03-2020   \n","2      3801       48753  Vagabonds  16-03-2020   \n","3      3802       48754        NaN  16-03-2020   \n","\n","                                       OriginalTweet Sentiment  \n","0  @MeNyrbie @Phil_Gahan @Chrisitv https://t.co/i...
